This repository contains my personal website. I want a small page with minimalt design. So, it is a static HTML page. To easy deployment it is embedded in a Nginx Docker image.

In the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) I have defined an external `${DOCKER_STACK}_proxy` network, thus the service easily bindable to a public domain. But I recommend to use [Traefik proxy](https://github.com/warnyul/traefik-docker-compose), because I have configured that already.
